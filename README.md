# Classics with LLMs - fine-tuning BERT for Iris dataset classification task

## Introduction
Ever wondered how new generation of LLMs handle classical ML tasks? Goal of this series of experiments is to verify how LLMs perform on classical datasets. This time we'll see how fine-tuned BERT handles the Iris classification task dataset.
